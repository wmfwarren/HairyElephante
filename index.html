				<h3>A Brief History</h3>
			</header>
			<p>
				In 19-Oh-Four our glorious founder comrade Marshall Firskicsovich-Warren realized that his elephant had some soft peach fuzz all over its body. Firskicsovich realized that it was too hot for his elephant around the park near his home in Siberia.
			</p>
			<p>
				So... he shaved it! And thus elephants became smooth. 
			</p>
			<p>
				With his Elephant weighing a whole 1kg less she was free to frolic and eat snow off of the ground in the park.

					Carlos, The Red Blur
				</h4>
			</header>
			<p>
				Carlos has always been a fan of our work, shaving his first elephant solo at only 7 years old (on the Mayan calendar). He has since come to work for us here at Elephant Shaves. Where his red razor flies so fast he has earned the name, The Red Blur.

				<h4>
					Gwenodlyn, She Who has Seen All
				</h4>
				<p>
					None really know Gwen's true age. All we really know is that she has seen it ALL. And will tell you all the things she has seen at any given opportunity. But fear not for your elephant's skin. Her telekinetic shaving technique makes her the closest shaver in the company.
