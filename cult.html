			<h3>The Family Mentality</h3>

				We live for our family, and our elephant (who are family). We believe that family is the most important aspect of everything. Soon you will be family, too. Just be reading this...

			<h3>We Are All Elephants</h3>
			<p>
				Really the title says it all. Just in case you are a little dense, here is an explanation. Hairy Elephante is the world's first elephant and he is the Allfather to both humans and elephant. Many years past, a mean old elephant cut off Hairy's trunk. For that the mean elephant was banished to human form. All mean elephants are just nice people; all people are just mean elephants.
